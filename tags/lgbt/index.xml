      <description>I just fished a documentary about the lives of LGBT people in China (and Hong Kong). One person from this documentary happened to be an elite in Hong Kong and he underwent sex reassignment surgery at a well-known clinic in Bangkok. She was very happy with the results and she relocated to Bangkok for however long, I don&amp;rsquo;t know. But what really got me thinking is the fact that she thought Thailand is more open to LGBT people.</description>
