      <description>One of my friends is a Syrian refugee, who was granted asylum in Sweden last year. I also want to try data analysis, so it fits that I should analyze something that&amp;rsquo;s relevant to my friend. This is my first ever analysis in pandas, apologies for code abomination in advance.
In this analysis, I use pandas for dataframe, numpy for dealing with numbers (because I need to count and do some math with it) and matplotlib for plotting graphs.</description>
