      <description>I just fished a documentary about the lives of LGBT people in China (and Hong Kong). One person from this documentary happened to be an elite in Hong Kong and he underwent sex reassignment surgery at a well-known clinic in Bangkok. She was very happy with the results and she relocated to Bangkok for however long, I don&amp;rsquo;t know. But what really got me thinking is the fact that she thought Thailand is more open to LGBT people.</description>

      <description>I was out for a stroll and I met a middle-aged person who, I think, knows my family. Without time being wasted, she asked &amp;ldquo;where do you study?&amp;rdquo; Where, not what.
Part of the reason why Thais ask &amp;ldquo;where&amp;rdquo; probably stems from the fact that they are a collective society, which means conformity and connections are very important. It&amp;rsquo;s safe to assume that people who went to the same school would &amp;ldquo;favor&amp;rdquo; people from their school when applying for jobs or asking for favors.</description>
