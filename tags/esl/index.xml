      <description>Earlier this year I volunteered at an “English Clinic” at my school. The premise was to let students practice English with fluent speakers. Read: they don’t really want to practice English.
First day in, only one student there. Two of my friends were there so we together helped her correcting her written homework. Half way in I still spoke English with her but I sensed something wrong. As it turned out, she barely understood what I was saying, so I resorted to speaking to her in her native language.</description>

      <description>Most Thais can’t speak fluent English and this is a fact. But some like to pretend they can.
I found a member recruitment post so I said to myself “hey this looks interesting-ish this is great finally Thais will have more resources to learn English.” Instant disappointment.
The first group I was in was created by a Thai who wants to work in Europe. Her English? Mia Farang English — very broken English.</description>
