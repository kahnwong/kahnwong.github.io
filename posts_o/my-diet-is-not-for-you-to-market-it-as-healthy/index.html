                <p>Assuming you&rsquo;re from the Anglosphere or live in trendy neighborhoods, you will see a lot of places offering gluten-free options and slapping &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; label on it. The problem arises when restauraners see the opportunity to cash in the gluten-free wave and start offering gluten-free options. This is an issue because, gluten-free is not just eliminating wheat, barley, rye or oat. It&rsquo;s more than that.</p>
<p>If you bake pizza using gluten-free flour in the <strong>same</strong> oven as regular pizza, it is considered <em>cross-contaminated</em> from floating flour dust in the air and some flour bits sticking to the oven, meaning it would contain gluten even if you use gluten-free flour.</p>
<p>Cross-contamination can happen a lot, and is hard to keep track of. A rule of thumb is to use separate set of cookwares when making gluten-free dishes. This is why people who cannot eat gluten rarely eat out - because it&rsquo;s very hard to find truly gluten-free places.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never heard of nut-free dishes as being healthy, or seafood-free dishes for the matter. So I guess they just see gluten as a fancy term and try to cash in the novelty. This wouldn&rsquo;t even be an issue if they actually make legit gluten-free food, instead we get half-baked gluten-free options that people like me can&rsquo;t eat without getting sick just so they can charge more.</p>
<p>And think about it: to parade a diet for life-threatening illness as healthy, that&rsquo;s very inconsiderate - that you only recognize gluten-free diet as being healthy, whereas for some people it&rsquo;s the only way they can continue to live.</p>
<p>If you ask me who&rsquo;s to blame, I would say the marketers. They need to cash in the fad, that&rsquo;s fine for me. But they did it in a very half-assed way, completely throwing people who really need to eat gluten-free under the bus.</p>
<p>Note that I make a distinction between promoting a bakery as &ldquo;made from rice flour&rdquo; or &ldquo;made from gluten-free flour.&rdquo; The former may contain gluten due to cross-contamination, the latter has to be truly gluten-free. But I&rsquo;m hoping too much, seeing these marketing terms are interchangable these days.</p>
<p>So what am I going to do about this? Nothing. I can&rsquo;t do anything except writing about this so people might know what gluten fad is like from our perspective. On the plus side, there are more gluten-free grocery options, and luckily the labels are mostly trustworthy. You win some, you lose some, such is how life works.</p>
