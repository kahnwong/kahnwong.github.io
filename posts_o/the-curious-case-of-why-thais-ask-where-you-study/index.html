            <div class="post-content">
                <p>I was out for a stroll and I met a middle-aged person who, I think, knows my family. Without time being wasted, she asked &ldquo;where do you study?&rdquo; Where, <em>not</em> what.</p>
<p>Part of the reason why Thais ask &ldquo;where&rdquo; probably stems from the fact that they are a collective society, which means conformity and connections are very important. It&rsquo;s safe to assume that people who went to the same school would &ldquo;favor&rdquo; people from their school when applying for jobs or asking for favors. Of course, discriminating people who went to &ldquo;different,&rdquo; probably &ldquo;inferior&rdquo; even, does happen.</p>
<p>You often see people getting upset over not getting into their desired college because a) it would disappoint their family and b) makes they look bad because they&rsquo;re not &ldquo;good&rdquo; enough to get in there. Some study at their second choice and try to get in their desired place next year - which is a waste of time if you ask me - also money.</p>
<p>Back to the topic. If I go through a script and answer &ldquo;I study at x,&rdquo; they would say &ldquo;why won&rsquo;t you go to $better_college.&rdquo; So now I&rsquo;m getting interrogated by a middle aged lady who just want to assert her opinion that a) I&rsquo;m not good enough and b) $her_kids are better than me.</p>
<p>As if all this is not traumatized enough, they will also ask (if you&rsquo;ve known to be a bright spark) &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you study medicine so you can help people and get good karma.&rdquo; Because that&rsquo;s not what I like. Simple as that. Studying medicine is not for everyone and even if I can get myself a med degree it doesn&rsquo;t mean I <em>have</em> to take it.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon either for parent(s) to force their child to take x degree because &ldquo;it pays better and people will respect you.&rdquo; A lot of fresh graduates end up taking another degree <em>for</em> themselves. A tragic story because all the time and money for fulfilling their parents desire are down the drain.</p>
<p>There. It&rsquo;s all out. Now let me go for a stroll in peace.</p>
